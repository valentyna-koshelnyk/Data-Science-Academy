    "\n",
    "Information extraction (IE) is the task of automatically extracting structured information from unstructured and/or semi-structured machine-readable documents. Information Extraction may be presented in three subtasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Named Entity Recognition**, retrieve entities (like persons, location, etc.) in the text. \n",
    "* **Relation Extraction**, find the relation between two entities in the text.\n",
    "* **Template Filling**, find the correct entity to fill a certain template, for instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this BLU we are going to learn some of the basic techniques to extract specific (pre-specified) information from textual sources. From the three specified task, we are going to **focus on the task of named-entity recognition (NER)** where our objective is to **retrieve all the mentions** of entities like persons, locations, time, among others. The other two are mentioned for the sake of completeness and you should definitely research more about them, specially if you're eager to learn more about NLP.\n",

       " \n",
       " She sits down on the bed and gestures me over and stops me when im leaning down to kiss her.

       " \n",
       " After willingly complying to her demands and eating her pussy she told me that i had waited long enough and now i was allowed to enter her.

       " I had to work her tight pussy slowly to begin with though and as she became more used to my girth she started to push against me and as my cock pushed a little further in each time she would let out a sigh.

This gorgeous Japanese woman taking my cock and shaking and one put she was moaning so hard i could see a vessel form on her forehead before she finally gasped for air and let go of the blankets.\n",
       " \n",
       " After seeing her let go i decided to lean down and scoop her up. Her legs dangling over my arms and i held onto her cute little ass.

       " \n",
       " So I placed her back onto the bed on all fours and teased her pussy and clit from behind with my cock before slowling re-entering her incredible pussy.

       " There was a moment I looked up and realised how cool everything was about this too as i looked out the window and saw osaka castle lit up and i stopped for a moment, still inside her and told her to look too.

Being an empath in this line of work is incredibly helpful because most people know what they want, but have zero idea how to put words to the vision in their heads. Just through conversation  (in person, of course!), I can get a solid feel for my clients' costuming desires. They seem to think it's magic that I \"just get them.\" :)  Oddly enough, I'm certain my empath abilities also translate into an ability to make things that fit perfectly the first time they try them on.\n",

       " 2) Mechanics is basically reaction time similar to gun skill.  All that you listed is relevant with one additional important note.  In Dota you acquire two resources: gold and experience.  You get these resources in three ways, killing creeps, killing enemy heroes, and killing towers.  In the early game killing creeps is the most important way to get these resources. The mid lane is as close at it gets to a fair fight (its a neutral lane not closer to either teams base and historically was played as a 1v1 contest) so there is a lot of contesting over last hits (also known as CS).  So people that find success in the mid lane tend to have really good reactions to win these 1v1s.  Also a lot of mid heroes are \"flashy\" with fast movement based abilities.  So you usually want your most mechanically talented player located there.\n",
       " \n",
       " 3) The offlaner is probably the most vulnerable (its sometimes called the hard lane) since you are usually playing 1 vs 2 or 3 heroes.  But mid and the mid tower are often a very important early advantage and the focus of a lot of action early on in the game.  Since you can teleport to towers and they give vision the mid tower (with its neutral central location) is a very important objective to open up space on the opponents side of the map.\n",
       " \n",
       " Recently the \"new meta\" has been the position 4 player sitting mid, turning mid into a duel lane vs its historical 1v1.  The nice thing about Dota is that there aren't really fixed positions for how you set up your lanes.  Every team will send 1 hero to each lane, but what you do with your two supports depends on draft and strategy.  You can go aggro and send them all to the offlane, you can have 1 in the safe lane and 1 roam, etc.  \n",
       " \n",
       " 4) Depends on the team, a lot of times coaches in Dota are picked up right before a LAN since they are often pro players that didn't qualify for the LAN.  For instance Pajkatt was the coach of DC during their TI6 2nd place run (Misery's team) since his team wasn't able to qualify.,\n",
